# React + Vite

Hello, this is a meme generator website. This project i built it as a practice on what i learned new with the current React course that I'm learning, the main things i learned recently and used it in this project are useState, props and useEffect. If you want to study the course that i'm studying, you can click this link { https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact }

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
